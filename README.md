# 2D-Skeletonization
Skeletonization and Summarization of Tracer Injected Data

The package contains the following parts:
- [Skeletonization Framework](https://github.com/MitraLab-Organization/2D-Skeletonization/tree/9a1f1d1b938d27199490caad0b072ac31945f182/Skektonization_Suite) - This provides the 2D skeletonization of the tracer-injected paper presented in the paper. 
- [Vectorization of Skeletonized Data](https://github.com/MitraLab-Organization/2D-Skeletonization/tree/9a1f1d1b938d27199490caad0b072ac31945f182/Vectorization) - The production of the GeoJSONs to be visualised on the website
- [Summarization of Skeletonization Data](https://github.com/MitraLab-Organization/2D-Skeletonization/tree/9a1f1d1b938d27199490caad0b072ac31945f182/Summarization) - The generation of the skeletons mapped to the RAF atlas and calculation of the densities in different regions of teh brain.
- [Tools & Utilities](https://github.com/MitraLab-Organization/2D-Skeletonization/tree/9a1f1d1b938d27199490caad0b072ac31945f182/Utilities) - Few tools used in the analysis, e.g. Suprise-Index, Weighted Neearest Neighbor Algorithm.
