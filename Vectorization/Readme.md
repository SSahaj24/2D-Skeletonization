## Create optimised geoJSON from Sketonization Output

- **Setup Matlab**:

  - Add the Path for `Image Graphs` in the Path
  - Make Sure the directory is writable.
 

- **Run Script** `script2rum.m`:

    `path := The path of the skeleton output by the Skeletonisation Algorithm`

    `outCC := An output path which gives the connected components of each section of the skeletal masks`

    `outJSON := The optimised output geoJSONs that can be used on the web or sent to Summarisation`
