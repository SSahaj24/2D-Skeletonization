## Create optimised geoJSON from Sketonization Output

- **Setup Matlab**:

  - Add the Path for `Image Graphs` in the Path
  - Make Sure the directory is writable.
 

- **Run Script** `script2rum.m`:

    `path := The path of the skelton outputed by the Skeletonisation Algorithm`

    `outCC := An output path which gives the connected components of each section of the skeletal masks`

    `outJSON := The optimized output geoJSONs that can be used as on web or sent to Summarization`
