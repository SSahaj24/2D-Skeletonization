This repository contains Python Notebooks to map Skeltons from the Input Space to the RAF space following registration Parameters.

The Notebooks also contain the Calculation of line densities in the RAF space.

The Notebook illustrates all the processes after the skeletonisation and vectorisation process.
It also includes the example of the Registration of the WSI brain to the RAF Atlas.
The Notebook also provides the intermediate results for viewing.

The Results are the line fragments in the Registered RAF space with their densities at each voxel of the atlas.

Although the Notebook is self-explanatory, we request readers to follow the steps from the [Registration](https://github.com/twardlab/emlddmm) first, before diving into the notebook further.
